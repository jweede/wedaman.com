# Resume Generator

## Motivation
Needed my resume to be available for several different mediums, so I made a simple generator using python. This makes updating my resume much easier since the data and the presentation are now separated.

Naturally, I thought I'd share and solicit feedback through Github ;)

## Usage

`render.py`: Uses [Jinja2][1] templates and the data (stored in the json file) and spews it into a web version (HTML static pages) and a print version (LaTeX compiled to PDF).
