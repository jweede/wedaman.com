There are some employers out there who contend that the value of a University education in CS is minimal, and Software Devs should be hired right out of high school. "They'll learn everything they need to know on the job [anyways](http://grammartips.homestead.com/anyway.html)!", they would say.

However companies are highly aware that time wasted equates to money wasted.

Take a look at the following example, which I borrowed from [this guy](http://www.skorks.com/2011/02/the-greatest-developer-fallacy-or-the-wisest-words-youll-ever-hear/):

 - Peter Norvig [solves Sodoku](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html)
 - Clueless Guy [tries](http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/OkSudoku) [to](http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/Sudoku2) [solve](http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/SudokuMusings) [Sodoku](http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/Sudoku4). 

To be honest, I thought his first few paragraphs were a huge sarcastic joke. No one in their right mind would be talking about "Test Driven Development"or other Agile Mantras in the context of a classic AI problem. However it appears this guy is completely serious, and he doesn't realize how much the "Agile hammer" has made every CS screw look like a nail. (please forgive the tortured simile).
